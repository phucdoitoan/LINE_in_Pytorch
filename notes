NOTE:

copy the whole thing in utils from LINE-tensorflow -> model run correctly with loss reduce to near 0 (0.00..) (for 2nd order)
old utils (the one inside "") => even though after 66000 batches, model's loss still stuck around 0.2 0.3 (dont know why)

=> AUC only around 0.56
while embed with tensorlow -> AUC of 0.77 and 0.87
WHY???

only with 10,000 batches LINE-tensorflow
has already given very good embedding with AUC around 0.75 and 0.89 (even > than convergence AUC for 2nd-order)
(after 36000 batches order-1 also achieve 0.77 AUC as convergence)

SGD for seems to converges very slowly:
tensorflow: 2nd-order: after 300,000 batches 1.7 -> 1.3-1.4 and AUC of only 0.5 -> does not learn enough
pytorch: 2nd-order: after 200,000 batches 1.7 -> 1.5 and AUC also 0.5

Adam:
tensorflow: loss do not go to -0.00  AUC of 0.811 (177,000 batch)
pytorch: loss go to -0.00 AUC of 0.511 (200,000 batch)
