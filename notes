NOTE:

copy the whole thing in utils from LINE-tensorflow -> model run correctly with loss reduce to near 0 (0.00..) (for 2nd order)
old utils (the one inside "") => even though after 66000 batches, model's loss still stuck around 0.2 0.3 (dont know why)

=> AUC only around 0.56
while embed with tensorlow -> AUC of 0.77 and 0.87
WHY???
